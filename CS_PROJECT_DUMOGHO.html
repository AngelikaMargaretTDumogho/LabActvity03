<h2>RACISM</h2>
<p class="highlight">Racism is different from racial prejudice, hatred, or discrimination. Racism involves one group having the power to carry out systematic discrimination through the institutional policies and practices of the society and by shaping the cultural beliefs and values that support those racist policies and practices
</p>

<h2>HISTORY</h2>
<p>Race and racism have been central to the organisation of Australian society since European colonisation began in 1788. As the First Peoples of Australia, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have borne the brunt of European colonisation and have a unique experience of racism. The process of colonisation, and the beliefs that underpin it, continue to shape Australian society today.
Racism adapts and changes over time, and can impact different communities in different ways, with racism towards different groups intensifying in different historical moments

<h2>CAUSES</h2>

<p>Racism often stems from fear and misunderstanding of those who are different, leading to the dehumanization of others based on race. Historical power dynamics and systemic inequalities can reinforce discriminatory beliefs and behaviors. Socialization plays a significant role, as individuals may adopt prejudiced views from family, peers, or media. Economic competition can exacerbate tensions,
as groups may feel threatened by others’ perceived success or resources. Finally, lack of education and exposure to diverse cultures can perpetuate stereotypes and foster an environment of intolerance.

<h3>1. Learn to recognize and understand your own privilege.</h3>

<p class="highlight">One of the first steps to eliminating racial discrimination is learning to recognize and understand your own privilege. Racial privilege plays out across social, political, economic, and cultural environments. Checking your privilege and using your privilege to dismantle systemic racism are two ways to begin this complex process.
However, race is only one aspect of privilege. Religion, gender, sexuality, ability-status, socio-economic status, language, and citizenship status can all affect your level of privilege. Using the privileges that you have to collectively empower others requires first being aware of those privileges and acknowledging their implications. Learn more about the many types of privilege.</p>

<h3>2. Examine your own biases and consider where they may have originated.</h3>

<p>What messages did you receive as a kid about people who are different from you? What was the racial and/or ethnic make-up of your neighborhood, school, or religious community? Why do you think that was the case? These experiences produce and reinforce bias, stereotypes, and prejudice, which can lead to discrimination. Examining our own biases can help us work to ensure equality for all.</p>

<h3>3. Validate the experiences and feelings of people of color.</h3>

<p>Another way to address bias and recognize privilege is to support the experiences of other people and engage in tough conversations about race and injustice. We cannot be afraid to discuss oppression and discrimination for fear of “getting it wrong.” Take action by learning about the ways that racism continues to affect our society.</p>
